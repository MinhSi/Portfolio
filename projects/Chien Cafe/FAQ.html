<h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions<b><h1>

<h5>GENERAL</h5>
<button class="accordion">What is this place?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Noir Chien Cafe Bar is half coffee shop, half dog rescue! Our dog lounge is an open space for guests to interact, play, and cuddle with rescue dogs, while enjoying some coffee, tea, or lemonade. All our dogs are available for adoption. While some guests come looking to adopt, some come just to hang out and relax with the pups. Both are welcome!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I bring my own dog?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot have guests bring in any dogs. Because we have lots of dogs of different ages, sizes, and personalities, it can take some time to introduce a new pup to the group dynamic.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Where do the dogs come from?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>All our dogs come from local city shelters! Once we get them from a shelter, they are with us until they are adopted</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Where does my entry fee go to?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We are a non-profit and all proceeds go towards helping our dogs. Many of them have medical needs that can be expensive. We want to make sure we are able to provide the best care possible for all our pups. Thank you for your support!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How can I donate?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We are happy to accept new or gently used dog supplies and bedding. These, as well as monetary donations can be dropped off in person. We are forever grateful for the support of our guests.</p>
</div>

<h5>VISITING</h5>
<button class="accordion">I want to come visit, but I lost my ID.</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Everyone over the age of 18 must provide proof of identification (birthday, photo, and legal name). If you do not have your ID with you, a photo of the ID is acceptable!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I'm not 18 yet but my friend/sibling/etc. is. Can they be my guardian?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unless they have been appointed by a judge to be your legal guardian, they cannot. We require the legal guardian to sign the liability waiver for any minor as well as be in the lounge with them at all times. Thank you for understanding.

</p>
</div>


<h5>ADOPTIONS</h5>
<button class="accordion">How does adoption work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We don't do any same-day adoptions. If you come in and fall in love with a pup, you can fill out our online application (same applies for fostering). From there, an adoption coordinator will get back to you to schedule a phone interview and home inspection (through skype/facetime). We also begin every adoption with a 1-week trial before the adoption is finalized to make sure the dog is the best fit for you, and vice versa.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How much is the adoption fee?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The fee can range anywhere from $200-$600, depending on the dog. The adoption coordinator will discuss the specific price with you after the application has been submitted.</p>
</div>
